Individual game project for Interactive Enertainment Technology Masters course

"Spook'd", a maze game with enemies that hunt you down and a Halloween aesthetic. The mazes are procedurally generated, and to allow the user to always have a chance at escaping, they contain no dead ends. There are two types of enemy; one is turn-based, the other moves at a constant rate. The number of enemies and speed of the second type of enemy can be set by the user. The LibGDX game engine was used to provide a framework and A* pathfinding functionality.
